# Section 3: Host to Host Communications

- **Network Characteristics**
	- Topology
	- Speed
	- Cost
	- Security
	- Availability
	- Scalability
	- Reliability

## OSI Model
- Standard by International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
- General Purpose, standardises how computers communicate with one another over a network.
- 7 Layers; Each layers servers the layer above, and is served by the layer betlow it. The layers are:
	- Application Layer
	- Presentation Layer
	- Session Layer
	- Transport Layer
	- Network Layer
	- Data Link Layer
	- Physical Layer

### Benefits
- Better interopertability <--> Better Standards.
- Work only with the layers you are concerned with.(ex: App devs only work with the the top 3 layers. Network Engineers concerend only with bottom 4).
- Easy to Troubleshoot.

## The TCP/IP Suite
- TCP/IP devloped in 1960 by US DoD's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).- Protocol stack comprising of multiple protocols along with **TCP** and **IP**.
- *Main protocol stack used in operations today.*
- OSI --> refrence model ; TCP/IP --> used to transfer data in production networks
